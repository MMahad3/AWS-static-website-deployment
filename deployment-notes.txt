---

🗓 Date: 2025-05-29  
👤 Deployed by: Mahad Munir  
💻 Project: Static Site Hosting with HTTPS (No custom domain)

---

## ✅ Steps Followed

1. Created S3 bucket named: `my-static-site-demo`
2. Enabled **Static Website Hosting** on the bucket
   - Index document: index.html
   - Error document: (left blank or error.html)
3. Uploaded files:
   - index.html
   - index.css
   - index.js

4. Verified site works via S3 website endpoint

---

## 🔐 Secured the Bucket

- Turned on: `Block all public access`
- Removed any existing public bucket policy

---

## 🔧 Created Origin Access Control (OAC)

- Go to: CloudFront > Security > Origin Access Control
- Created new OAC:
  - Name: `S3-OAC`
  - Signing behavior: Always
  - Origin type: S3

---

## 🌍 Created CloudFront Distribution

- Origin domain: selected S3 bucket `.s3.amazonaws.com`
- Origin access: `Origin access control settings`
- Selected OAC: `S3-OAC`
- Enabled: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Default root object: `index.html`

✅ Status: Created and Deployed  
🌐 CloudFront URL: `https://dXXXXXXXXXXXX.cloudfront.net`

---

## ❌ Error Faced

### ❗ AccessDenied Error on CloudFront
- Cause: S3 bucket policy didn’t allow CloudFront to access
- Fix:
  - Manually added bucket policy with:
    - `cloudfront.amazonaws.com` principal
    - Correct SourceArn (CloudFront distribution)
    - Correct bucket ARN

✅ Resolved: CloudFront can now read files from private S3 bucket

---

## 🔐 Final Security

- S3: Public access fully blocked
- Only CloudFront (OAC) has read access
- No direct access via S3 URL
- Site is served securely via HTTPS (CloudFront)
